    title: "Hurricane Harvey: Five Years Later - Key Lessons for Texas Energy Infrastructure",
    excerpt: "Analyzing the $125 billion impact of Hurricane Harvey on Texas energy operations and the critical infrastructure lessons that continue to shape resilience planning today.",
    content: `
      <p>Five years after Hurricane Harvey devastated the Texas Gulf Coast, the energy industry continues to implement lessons learned from what became one of the most costly natural disasters in U.S. history. With over $125 billion in total economic losses, Harvey fundamentally changed how we approach weather risk assessment for critical infrastructure.</p>

      <h2>The Scale of Impact</h2>
      <p>Harvey's unprecedented rainfall—over 60 inches in some areas—caused catastrophic flooding that shut down approximately 25% of U.S. refining capacity. The Port Arthur Refinery, Baytown Refinery, and numerous petrochemical facilities along the Houston Ship Channel experienced extended outages that rippled through global energy markets.</p>

      <h2>Infrastructure Vulnerabilities Exposed</h2>
      <p>The storm revealed critical weaknesses in facility design and emergency preparedness:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Elevation Planning:</strong> Many facilities lacked adequate elevation above historical flood levels</li>
        <li><strong>Power Systems:</strong> Backup power systems failed when flood waters exceeded design parameters</li>
        <li><strong>Transportation Access:</strong> Road and rail infrastructure failures isolated facilities from supply chains</li>
        <li><strong>Communication Networks:</strong> Emergency communication systems proved inadequate during extended outages</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Current Risk Assessment Standards</h2>
      <p>Today's weather risk assessments for Texas energy facilities must incorporate Harvey's lessons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>NOAA precipitation data analysis extending beyond historical 100-year flood models</li>
        <li>Storm surge modeling combined with inland flooding scenarios</li>
        <li>Critical infrastructure interdependency mapping</li>
        <li>Supply chain vulnerability assessments for extended outage scenarios</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
      <p>As climate patterns continue to evolve, Harvey serves as a critical case study for facility planning. Modern risk assessments must consider not just the direct impact of extreme weather, but the cascading effects on interconnected systems that keep Texas energy operations running.</p>

      <p>The data from Harvey continues to inform our understanding of extreme weather exposure across the Texas energy corridor, providing essential insights for facility-specific risk evaluation and emergency preparedness planning.</p>

    title: "Winter Storm Uri: When Texas Energy Infrastructure Faced the Big Freeze",
    excerpt: "How February 2021's historic freeze event shut down 26% of U.S. refining capacity and reshaped cold weather preparedness across Texas energy operations.",
    content: `
      <p>Winter Storm Uri in February 2021 brought unprecedented cold to Texas, with temperatures plummeting to levels not seen in decades. The event created a perfect storm of equipment failures that temporarily shut down 26% of U.S. refining capacity and highlighted critical gaps in cold weather preparedness across the energy sector.</p>

      <h2>The Temperature Crisis</h2>
      <p>Uri brought sustained sub-freezing temperatures across Texas for nearly a week, with some areas experiencing temperatures below 0°F. This extended cold snap exceeded the design parameters for much of the state's energy infrastructure, which was primarily engineered for hot, humid conditions rather than Arctic-level cold.</p>

      <h2>Refinery Shutdowns and Market Impact</h2>
      <p>Major refineries across Texas were forced to shut down operations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Port Arthur Complex:</strong> Complete shutdown due to power outages and frozen equipment</li>
        <li><strong>Houston Area Facilities:</strong> Multiple refineries reduced capacity by 50-80%</li>
        <li><strong>East Texas Operations:</strong> Several smaller facilities completely offline for 5-7 days</li>
        <li><strong>Pipeline Systems:</strong> Critical pipeline infrastructure experienced reduced flow capacity</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Equipment Failure Patterns</h2>
      <p>Uri revealed specific vulnerability patterns in Texas energy infrastructure:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Instrument Air Systems:</strong> Compressed air systems failed when moisture froze in lines</li>
        <li><strong>Heat Tracing:</strong> Inadequate heat tracing on critical process lines led to blockages</li>
        <li><strong>Water Systems:</strong> Fire protection and utility water systems experienced widespread freezing</li>
        <li><strong>Electrical Systems:</strong> Power grid failures compounded individual facility vulnerabilities</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Updated Cold Weather Standards</h2>
      <p>Post-Uri risk assessments for Texas energy facilities now incorporate:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Extended cold weather duration modeling (7+ day events)</li>
        <li>Equipment winterization requirements for sub-20°F operation</li>
        <li>Backup power redundancy for critical heating systems</li>
        <li>Supply chain disruption planning for extended cold weather events</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Implications for Risk Planning</h2>
      <p>Uri demonstrated that Texas energy infrastructure must be prepared for extreme weather events that exceed historical norms. Modern facility risk assessments should include both hot and cold weather extremes, recognizing that Texas's energy infrastructure operates in an environment where both 110°F summers and sub-zero winters are possible.</p>

      <p>The economic impact of Uri—estimated at over $195 billion across Texas—underscores the critical importance of comprehensive weather risk assessment that includes low-probability, high-impact events in facility planning and operational preparedness.</p>
